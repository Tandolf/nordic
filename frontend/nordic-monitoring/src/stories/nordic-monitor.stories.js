EMOM 7-8 min: \n3-4 Front Squats -> 3-5 Back Squats\n(first 3 sets are front squats and the rest are back squats - increase weight slightly)","C. EMOM 7-8 min: \n6-8 slow-ish Seated, slight lean back double Dumbbell Press (set DBs down very gently)","D. EMOM 7-8  min: \n4-7 Strict Pull-ups (alt. behind head and regular if possible)"],"instructions":["A. Hook grip on all pulling. Release in rack. Calm start from under knees but accelerate towards full extension and slight touch on middle of thighs. Solid rack and firmly planted feet in thrusters and in split jerk. Split jerk is with focus on timing and precision. Own the movements. Bring bar down gently, with control. Weights will probably not be heavy enough to require a dump.","B. No really heavy weights here. The volume and lack of rest will get to you. Focus on posture. Firmly planted feet. Go straight down and straight up with drive from ass. Front squats are done with a rack position similar to a general who is having a picture taken.","C. Sit on a bench with the back support almost upright. Do controlled, continuous dumbbell presses from deep rack position to fully extended arms. Exact positions of hands and arms are determined by you. Do them so that they are comfortable and you feel strong.","D. So beautiful pull-ups from straight arms up until chin is above bar OR bar is behind head. Alternate between the two versions but only do this if they cause no worrying discomfort. Throw away your ego on this one. Use a rubber band to get through all the sets with quality."]},{"date":1569931200,"workouts":["A.

Any type of weight is allowed. Kettlebell or dumbbell and in rare cases, barbells. You have to come all the way up and down again before taking help from the other hand. Take no stupid risks.","B. With an AbMat under your lower back, lie on the floor with legs almost straight (to get the lower body to counter weight the upper body + weight). Hold a dumbbell or weight plate on chest. Do sit-ups in a controlled manner but never come up to full sit and never go down to relaxed position. Keep shoulder blades off floor. Row methodically and efficiently. Windmills with feet at a bit outside shoulder width. Hold weight on straight right arm. Right foot pointing ahead. Left foot pointing more the the left. Keep legs straight or almost straight. Push hips back and to the side with back straight while looking up at the weight. Do not go deeper than a depth that allows for straight back. Then move from lying with chest on floor to up and over box. Never let dumbbells hit floor hard. Focus on the stepping do avoid stumbling. Hang at shoulder width apart with thumbs pointing inwards. Lift your knees as high as you can while leaning back. Rotate the legs from side to side in an elastic manner. No super long range of motion. If you can, raise your hips to the same height as your shoulders. Keep them there and rotate legs extended, kept together, from side to side. Then start the travel on all four. Knees close to floor, back neutral and continuous stepping in a controlled manner. Get up and run the remainder of the 4  30m-stretches."]},{"date":1570017600,"workouts":["A. 12 min Technique\nHandstand walk in doses of 10-15 seconds at a time and focus on actually being upside down for real and walking with or without spotter","2 X 10 min pieces @ 80% effort.

Get the most out of the 12 minutes. Practice handstand walk in a way that both lets you feel that you can manage the version And has you challenged. You should also (towards the end of the 12 min) be tired in shoulders and arms. This time, let's see if you can actually take steps in inverted position. Either kick up towards a spotter that is standing in front of you when you kick up (and control you either by holding on to your lower legs or by having your legs rest against a stick) or walk/get help up into a very high \"wheel barrow\"-position where the spotter is behind you. In the wheel barrow-version, you will have to take very small steps and synch them almost in a rhythmical manner with the spotter, in order to not collapse. Take true rest between attempts.","B. Calm and efficient hang clean high pulls with tight bar path and with bar touching mind thigh or slightly higher in sunch with full extension. Pull elbows up but not super high. Bar reaching high belly is good. Then get it up into a solid rack. Firmly planted feet. Drive calmly with power from both quads and glutes. Bar is close to throat until it leaves for the fantastic adventure upwards. Bring it back to the same rack position and repeat seamlessly. Lunges are calm and with focus on balance. Trailing knee never touches floor. Back squats are upright and down straight down and up with almost slow execution. Sprawls are efficient. Do not go below a plank position in bottom. Then sit on your ass. Hands on floor behind you. Legs at ca. 90° with feet at slightly wider than shoulder width. Lay/fold both legs to the left so that both knees come in contact with the floor. Then to the right. Alternate sides like that in a calm manner.","D. Efficient, methodical row with synch between breathing and strokes in a correlation that works. Put effort into the strokes and recover on the way forward. So push/pull back and then glide forward slowly to reload for the next stroke. Respect the prescribed strokes per minute. Run fast but relaxed, except for on of the stretches, where you really push."]},{"date":1570104000,"workouts":["3 X 8 min @ 85-90% effort. 3 min rest/transition between","A.

Put the dumbbells on the floor at about shoulder width. Do a push-up on them and then jump in as for a burpee but with feet wider than the dumbbells. In one motion, lift/pull/snatch/clean+press them up to overhead on straight arms as you also stand up completely to fully extended position. Get them down (with gentle set-down) and repeat. Enjoy. Let the KBs hang in vertical arms. Do the reverse lunges with upright back but upper body leaning forward at hips. Front foot is firmly planted and knee moves forward over knee. Drive up before trailing knee touches floor. Run fast but relaxed.","B. Stand over the ball, get your hands under it, aim for upright posture, lift it up a a bit and get a hug-grip around it. Get the ball close. Use full body (hips and back) to get it up on one of your shoulders. Drop it in front and repeat. Alternate which shoulder it rolls over. Use full body (arms included) for the jumps. Land with control, stand up to fully extended legs and hips and step off. ","C. Knees to elbows are done in rhythm to allow for all reps unbroken at a challenging height. Really try to get your knees to make contact with the elbows. You can bend arms slightly to achieve this. Walk up with feet along wall, from push-up position with body kept as much in \"hollow\" as possible. Small, controlled steps. Come as high up/as close to a handstand as you can handle with no risk. If you can close enough for contact, you only touch wall with nose and toes (nothing else). Wherever you can stop, hold position and shift weight between hands and maybe lift unloaded hand. Goblet squats are done with solid grip/rack, upright posture and firmly planted feet. Put down gently."]},{"date":1570190400,"workouts":["A. E90s X 8 sets:\n3 Weighted Pull-ups (COVP) (thumbs pointing inwards (pronated grip) @ 85-100% effort, with ambition to nail PR on one of the sets\n _Compare to 190802","B.

From straight arms to above the bar with the chin (not in height with bar but chin actually right over the bar). Legs remain straight. Shoulders are kept down in top position.","B. Let dumbbells hang in straight arms. Walk forward with focus on balance and finding elasticity in whole front leg (mostly glute). Drive up before trailing knee touches floor. Let front knee move forward if necessary for whole front foot to be able to push evenly. Put dumbbells down VERY GENTLY.","C. Bench press is done with feet pushing against floor for support. Butt kept in contact with bench. Firm, hard grip on bar at width that you are strong with. All the way down to chest and up to straight arms. Look straiht up towards the ceiling. Hold at a width that is comfortable and where you feel strong.

Alt. E2M X 8 sets (4 of each) @ 85-90% effort\nB1. 12-28 cal. Assault bike\nB2. 15-35 cal. Row (with straps, damper <4)"],"instructions":["A. Maybe stand on two low plates (one under each foot) for the sumo deadlifts in order to get more range and elasticity, if you have the mobility. Feet at about double shoulder width and turned out slightly. Grip bar at around shoulder width so that you hold at least some of the knurling. Focus on posture and control. No sloppy lifting. Keep KBs in secure rack position and sit straight down with upright posture. Move calmly and use force from legs to press up all the way and lead arms and KBs down to secure rack and repeat seamlessly. Look straight ahead and keep mouth open. Burpee-pull-ups are done in version that allows for pretty speedy reps with no hesitation. The forward rolls are done if you are comfortable doing them. Safety first. Make sure you keep the hands pushing and tuck the chin in. Always do them with forward momentum. Run fast but relaxed.","B. Boom! Cyclical shit-show. Start hard on the bike for 3-4 seconds and then settle into normal high speed. Use whole body and breathe as calmly as you can. Start row with a few short and hard strokes before you settle into normal high speed and synch strokes with breathing somehow."]},{"date":1570363200,"workouts":["In teams of two, go through the three 10 min Amraps, one round each at a time. 2 min rest between them.","A.

Toes to bar are unbroken but challenging. Choose a height accordingly. Place a bulgarian back over your back and hold it down tightly. Do the jumping lunges with a slight lean forward and focus on balance. Never let trailing knee hit ground. No stress in this combo. It will break both of you.","B. Lie down beside a ball that will simulate a human. Hug it and roll it over you to the other side. Release grip fully and then repeat the process. Use full body to generate force in box jumps. Maintain a low center of gravity and slide off like the ninja you are.","C. Keep back straight, stand with feet pretty close to each other. Aim to bend knees more than you do in regular deadlifts, in order to not do these primarily through hips and spine. Look straight ahead. Heavy but beautiful. Do the push-ups with focus on control and do not risk tipping the KBs. Body in straight line and look straight ahead. Run relaxed and fast in order to at least partially recover."]}]}];
